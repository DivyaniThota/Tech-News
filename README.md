##GOAL:

The objective of this project is to develop a News app using SwiftUI, leveraging web content display. Since SwiftUI does not provide built-in support for rendering web content, this project demonstrates how to seamlessly integrate web views into SwiftUI using UIViewRepresentable or UIViewControllerRepresentable wrappers.

##ABOUT:

I have created a news app called Tech News that fetches data from the Hacker News Algolia API. Users can navigate to a separate screen via a navigation link to access the latest technology updates sourced from the API. This app serves as a platform for users to stay informed about the most recent developments in the tech world.

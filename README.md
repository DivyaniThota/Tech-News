## GOAL

The objective of this project is to develop a News app using SwiftUI, leveraging web content display. Since SwiftUI does not provide built-in support for rendering web content, this project demonstrates how to seamlessly integrate web views into SwiftUI using UIViewRepresentable or UIViewControllerRepresentable wrappers.

## ABOUT

I have created a news app called Tech News that fetches data from the Hacker News Algolia API. Users can navigate to a separate screen via a navigation link to access the latest technology updates sourced from the API. This app serves as a platform for users to stay informed about the most recent developments in the tech world.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED

- Xcode
- Swift
- SwiftUI
- WebKit
- Hacker News Algolia API

## FEATURES

- Showcases up-to-date technology news in web format.
- Indicates the post popularity by displaying the number of hits each post receives.
- Demonstrates the seamless transition to the next screen using navigation links within SwiftUI, ensuring smooth user navigation.

The primary focus of this project lies in integrating the WebKit framework into a SwiftUI project. Below is a screenshot showcasing the implementation for visual reference.
